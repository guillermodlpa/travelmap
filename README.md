# Travelmap

![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)

[![Built with TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%2F%3E-TypeScript-%230074c1.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

This is a small web application that allows to make a list of visited countries, display them in a map, and share the URL.

Built with NextJS, React, TypeScript, and Groomet.

## Development

This is a NextJS app, so you can run it locally with

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note you'll need to configure a Mapbox access token in `.env.local` to render the map.
