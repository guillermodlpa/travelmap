# Travelmap

This is a small web application that allows to make a list of visited countries, display them in a map, and share the URL.

Built with NextJS, React, TypeScript, and Groomet.

## Development

This is a NextJS app, so you can run it locally with

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note you'll need to configure a Mapbox access token in `.env.local` to render the map.
