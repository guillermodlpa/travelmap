# Travelmap Auth0 Actions

Travelmap authentication is implemented using Auth0. Via actions, we keep in sync Auth0 data with Travelmap data.

The actions here are copied from the Auth0 Actions web-based code editor, just to keep things organized.

A better approach would be to create an npm package for the action logic, and implement the action in Auth0 as simply pulling that package and calling the function.
